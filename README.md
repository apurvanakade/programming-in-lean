# Programming in Lean

These are my notes while learning from the book: https://github.com/arthurpaulino/lean4-metaprogramming-book

I intend to eventually move on to reading: https://leanprover.github.io/functional_programming_in_lean/

I make note of any interesting thoughts here: https://github.com/apurvanakade/programming-in-lean/wiki
