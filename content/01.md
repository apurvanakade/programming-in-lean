## Getting Lean

The instructions [here](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/quickstart.html) did not work for me as I already some `elan` and `lean4` versions from contributing to `mathlib`. 

So I had to run `elan default leanprover/lean4:stable` which I found [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Set.20up.html).

After this restarting VSCode did the job. I also did `lake init porject-name` in this folder just to be safe.
